       <p> and the highest sea otter density of anywhere along the Californian coast, Elkhorn Slough nestled in the middle of the Monterey Bay may rightly be considered a sort of ecological Eden. The silver snaking estuary, so called because of its ‘elk horn’ shape when viewed from above, winds its way past wetlands to the ocean. Today, the Elkhorn Slough Foundation protects 4000 acres of land surrounding the Slough. The two 500-foot stacks, relics from the Pacific Gas & Electric plant still dominate the skyline, symbolic reminders of a dramatic slice of history recently explored in Glenn Church and Kathryn McKenzie’s book <i>‘Humbled: How California’s Monterey Bay escaped industrial ruin.’</i> One year short of the Elkhorn Slough Foundation’s fortieth anniversary and in the wake of COP 26, I interviewed the authors of <i>‘Humbled’</i> as well as director of the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, Mark Silberstein, to try to understand the inner mechanics of an environmental battle credited to have kickstarted the environmental movement along the West coast.
       <br>
       <br>
       The controversy came about because of a measure passed by the Monterey County Board of Supervisors in September 1965 to approve plans for an oil refinery proposed to be built at Moss Landing. Humble Oil (now ExxonMobil) was attracted to Moss Landing specifically, because of its deep-water port which could facilitate super tankers and spare the need for oil to be lighted before unloading it on land. Strongly opposed by the Monterey Peninsula and Carmel set, the refinery was unpopular in the south of the county where people did not want to see the natural beauty of their coastline compromised. With support from key environmentalists such as Ruth Andresen and Ansel Adams, the opposition assumed what would be described today as an environmentalist stance, focussing in on the effects of pollution. Amongst the supporters of the refinery were Salinas famers such as rancher Douglas Allmond and artichoke grower, Don Barsotti. Supporters were keen to diversify the County’s economy and welcome in other heavy industry that would surely follow Humble’s development. As events progressed, the farming community became increasingly divided. Dave Williams, farm superintendent for Bruce Church Inc. played a critical role in achieving this, emphasising the devastating impacts the refinery’s pollutants would have on agriculture, a key pillar of the county’s economy. In order to protect agriculture, proponents of the refinery insisted on stringent regulations that ultimately proved too much for Humble. After two years of battling for its spot on the Monterey Bay coast Humble gave up, taking their refinery plans to Benicia, in Solano County.

       <br>
      Glenn and Kathryn’s book is in part, a book about the remarkable shift in the perception of the environment and the natural world more generally in the years leading up to the controversy. It was only two years previous in 1963, that plans to expand the existing PG&E plant had passed through hassle free. ‘If Humble were to have come in a year or two earlier, they would have built this,’ Glenn Church told me in a joint interview with his wife and co-author Kathryn McKenzie. ‘This was missed by a hair.’ Events took place at a time of growing environmental consciousness. It was only a few years previous in 1962 that Rachel Carson had published ‘Silent Spring’ which made real the devastating effects of DDT and in doing so presented the environment as something vulnerable to human interference. DDT had decimated the Pelican populations along the Californian coastline and Carson had had a significant influence on the thinking of geologist and environmentalist Ruth Andresen, an active opponent of Humble. The environmental movement in this period was coming to terms with itself and author Julia Reynolds in her praise for the book, rightly states that the tale should serve as inspiration for ‘all of us to keep fighting for environmental justice.’ However, speaking with Glenn and Kathryn it became apparent that this was not a straightforward victory of environmental activism; of the angelic eco-warriors at Carmel defeating the demonic self-interest of big business. Whilst, as James Perry the Monterey County Historical Society Executive notes, the story does read like ‘a sweeping epic-’, concluding climactically with satanic Humble being cast out of Paradise, the reality was far more complex. ‘The environmental issue,’ says Glenn, ‘was almost a minor role.’ ‘If you want to understand why Humble left, you have to look at the <i>pro</i>ponents.’
       <br>
       <br>
       Economic interest was the primary motivation for Humble supporters. When all was said and done, Robert Elking, secretary manager of the Salinas Chamber of Commerce reflected on the defeat, ‘I think Monterey County is going to miss this boost to our economy.’ The Californian bitterly announced the result as a ‘great victory, for the reactionaries, for the prosperously retired and the gullible.’ When the poverty rate of Salinas today, sits at a steady 17.2%, it’s hard not to wonder what difference heavy industry could have made to the county’s prosperity. I put this to the authors. Glenn explained that at the time the County’s economy consisted of three legs: agriculture, tourism, and the military. Through its pollution and ugliness, the refinery ‘was going to threaten two of those main legs.’ And so, much of the opposition particularly from the agricultural communities, were similarly motivated by economic interests. It wasn’t really a dispute about the environment versus the economy, but about economic timescales. Should the county invest in heavy industry for the next fifty years or protect its more sustainable and long-term economies? Ultimately, it was about waking up to the fact that if the environment was not protected, this posed a threat to the very pillars of the county’s economy. I spoke with director of the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, Mark Silberstein about the economic sustainability of the surrounding wetland area. ‘Based on the archaeological record, people have made their living at Elkhorn Slough for almost 10,000 years,’ said Mark, ‘farmland is forever, you can refine oil for a little while, and plants like that have a life-span.’ The PG&E stacks a striking reminder- ‘You have to ask the question, what kind of trade-offs are you making?’

       <h3>'sometimes you have to vote for a project you do not want, but you can kill it with the conditions.’ </h3>

       <br>
       Whilst it seemed Carson had joined the dots between pesticides and ecological damage; within the County it was Dave Williams, farm superintendent for Bruce Church Inc.  who was joining the dots between ecological and economic damage: ‘The decision you gentlemen make can have an effect on tens of thousands of acres, and millions of dollars’ worth of crops,’ said Williams at an earlier county meeting. Whilst Williams may have been responsible for dividing support amongst the agricultural community, this warning united them in respect to economic interests; whichever side of the fence farmers stood, limiting damage to crops was priority. Monterey Bay has an inversion layer similar to that of LA, which means pollution would have nowhere to escape to. ‘People in Monterey County were aware of how bad the pollution was in LA,’ Kathryn explained, ‘agriculture had been forced out of the San Francisco Bay Area, the Santa Clara Valley and much of Southern California because of air pollution which had decimated crops.’ The proponents cared about pollution, and it was their economic interest in the environment that motivated the proponents to create and commit to their regulations.
       <br>
       <br>
       One of the most significant legacies of the controversy were the regulatory laws introduced. According to Glenn, ‘While Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River was steadying forth environmental law, Monterey County has not been given credit for steadying forth the regulatory laws.’ Laws that would not just affect oil refineries but ‘basically all heavy industry.’ During the second meeting in September, key players in the agricultural community, decided to set out their conditions for the potential refinery. ‘It was Dave Williams who stepped forward at that point and said, we’re going to have this, but can we limit it?’ Glenn says, meanwhile those from the Pebble Beach area were still parroting ‘stop it entirely, stop it entirely.’ ‘Really,’ he continued, ‘[Humble] was stopped because of the conditions.’ Humble was shocked by the regulations of which kind, they had never seen before. Judging that the deep-water port was not worth the effort of adhering to Monterey’s strict regulations, they left with their proposals for Benicia. Having left Monterey, the significance of the controversy on Humble’s thinking became apparent. Benicia, desperate for the industry, did not put forward any regulations for the refinery. Yet, Humble spent a staggering 10 million dollars on painting and landscaping in order to try and blend their tanks into the environment. Glenn says, ‘I think they took a lot of those ideas from Monterey County.’
       <br>
       <br>
       So nearly fifty-five years on, what lessons can we draw from the Humble controversy?
       <br>
       <br>
       The retrospective ‘environmental’ victory is an obvious legacy; the events marked a watershed moment in public perceptions of the environment and the recognition of human dependence upon it. A legacy made vivid today through the thriving biodiversity and scenic beauty of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Elkhorn Slough. Second, is the legacy of those pioneering regulatory laws and their impact on heavy industry which up until this book, has not been fully acknowledged. But in our interview, Glenn reaches towards something else, ‘There was something exceptional going on here in this community and even now I don’t know if I can really put my finger on it.’ This ‘exceptional’ quality of the Monterey County community during the mid-sixties is elusive and Glenn and Kathryn plan on writing a second edition to explore further. However, I think it may be something to do with the community’s awareness of its own voice and by dint of this, its power. The result was not so much a victory of environmentalists over villainous industrialists but the conclusion of a two-year-long dialogue within a community awake to its capabilities as people with passion working together.

       Addressing young environmental activists in a speech at the recent COP 26, ex-president Barack Obama stressed the importance of this kind of engagement with politics. He suggested the limitations of protest and hashtags, urging young people to engage with traditional politics ‘at some level.’ Obama claimed ‘you can’t ignore it. You can’t be too pure for [politics],’ or as Glenn Church calls it, ‘sausage making’- the dirty, hard work of negotiation belying all major social movements. ‘Today politically, we are very bitterly divided,’ says Glenn, ‘there’s no room for compromise,’ - a quality, Obama argues in his speech, that will be required of young people in the fight against climate change. The Humble controversy is a story of compromises. ‘I learnt that from my dad,’ Glenn continues, ‘that sometimes you have to vote for a project you do not want, but that you can kill it with the conditions.’
       <br>
       <br>
       Ultimately, this environmental victory was achieved through debate, grit and perhaps counter-intuitively, compromise. Indeed, no one is too pure for politics and environmentalism is deeply political. As Obama urges young people to ‘stay angry,’ it is also worth remembering what can be achieved when we enter into discussions and engage with the ‘villains’ of the climate crisis dialogue. In an age where we can find ourselves feeling helpless as major states fall short of global climate ambitions, we would do well to recognise the potential of community dialogue- a precious resource today, which seems to have been left largey untapped.

       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>Hunched around the Coachella livestream we opened a succession of chaotic snapchat videos from our friend who had been particularly jammy in securing tickets. Not even a Styles fan himself, we rolled our eyes at his footage, secretly revelling the privilege of what felt like our own private if blurry coverage of the festival. Back home in the UK Coachella feels like an otherworldly event. Whilst the festival is both exclusive and exotic, I’ve noticed a certain snobbery among Brits towards the festival of influencers and immaculate dry-weather fashion. In contrast to mucky, laddy British festivals and the sweet gritty cheer that bubbles up from their sodden fields, Coachella seems sunshine-sanitised. This year however, huddled in a college dorm room just a day’s drive from the action, we couldn’t help but pay a little closer attention, parking our cynicism for the weekend- if only out of curiosity…
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Through the little phone screen, we could glimpse the raw excitement of the crowd; through the bigger laptop screen we gleaned a sense of why. Dressed in hot pink Gucci pants and leather waistcoat to match, femininity was the first explosive impression. Dancing with optimistic abandon, his little diamante studded bottom could be compared to that of Jagger’s whilst his careful fashion commitments to the likes of Prince and Bowie. Shedding his former boy-band image, Styles’ stage presence, fashion, dancing all appears very self-conscious yet his boy-next-door, grounded personality means this rarely feels overwrought. Dressed as a feminine cowboy of vague cosmic origin, Styles is a transatlantic amalgam of influences, creating something altogether new. He belts to a crowd aware of the significance of this performance.
<br>

A few weeks passed and our regrets for not scrounging last minute Coachella tickets were beginning to fade. Exams over and our time in the States fast running out we blew the remainder of our Brexit money (or Turing Scheme grant) on a plane ticket to Hawaii. On the day ‘Harry’s House’ was released we had taken a bus to the hippie town of Paia, Maui. Despite playing the album through several times around the hostel we hadn’t yet absorbed it fully when we stumbled across the House of Fleetwood.
<br>
<br>
<br>
None of us had ever seen Styles’ clothing line ‘Pleasing’ in real life and with Harry on our minds we were quick to recognise the lanky whispering frog that popped from lemon yellow cotton in the shop window. Naturally, in we went.
<br>
<br>
From the outside, this little shop has white wooden panels and bright yellow pillars. Inside, Fleetwood Mac merchandise and memorabilia plasters the walls, and you can buy star sign postcards, band T-shirts and ‘Pleasing’.
<br>
<br>
‘The only shop in the states to sell “Pleasing,”’ says a voice from a back room. Kells Jesse owns the House of Fleetwood and proudly shows us a photograph of him on the Rumours tour aged just 18. When the only British accent you’ve heard for months has been from the handful of British international students, Kells’ London accent cut through the shop like a knife.

The collaboration between Mick Fleetwood and Harry Styles’ brand ‘Pleasing’ is an interesting one. As the star’s new image continues to evolve it is tempting to read into this collaboration as indication of his artistic trajectory. A big framed promotional photograph of Mick Fleetwood in a fantastic hot pink waistcoat (not dissimilar to Harry’s Coachella waistcoat but more traditional in its shape with absolutely no sign of diamante) hangs proudly at the base of the stairs. Excited to hear a fellow British accent, we introduce ourselves and ask a few questions about Fleetwood and a few more about Styles.
<br>
<br>
‘I’ve met him [Harry] a few times,’ -we gawp, ‘a really genuine bloke.’ Mick’s opinion of him? ‘He’s got it.’
<br>
<br>
We tell Kells Jesse that we’re going to see Styles’ ‘Love on Tour’ when we get back to the UK. Persuaded by not one glass of Target’s cheapest Californian wine, this had been an impulse decision made the very night he played at Coachella. We tell him the date, it’s in June- for the first time feeling a little less anxious about the prospect of returning to England, after what will have been almost a year away.
<br>
<br>
Leaving the shop light on our feet, we’re not quite sure how we managed to stumble across this gem along Hana Highway, Maui… Very Pleasing indeed.

As we listen to Styles obsessively along the winding Maui lanes, a couple of tracks emerge as favourites. A groovy, warbling bass line on Music for a Sushi Restaurant instructs back seat dancing. Where would Harry place this in his set? Not too close to Treat People with Kindness we conclude, its erupting trumpet breaks just as joyful, another proper pop song. A second favourite, perhaps because of the acutely familiar stress of travel, is Keep Driving. Disjointed impressions of an overwhelmed car passenger express an anxiety that grows throughout the track, finally settling on the gentle question ‘should we just keep driving?’ Images of youthful fun and travel are underscored by persistent danger, ‘camera…hot wax…jump off the roof,’ fuelling an anxiety that builds as the tempo increases and the scale of the lyric’s imagery expands, ‘Passports…tea with cyborgs!’ Styles wails. More abstracted, ‘America…Science,’ total overwhelm threatens to tilt us into blank panic when dynamic and tempo skip down abruptly to a cool suggestion: ‘should we just keep driving?’ And driver and passenger roll on never to be seen again.

Four days later and there’s mutiny in the back seat- one of the girls has had enough. An Arctic Monkeys fan she craves something grittier than the saccharine fruit obsessed song titles we’ve been playing exclusively on repeat. But this is no democracy; drivers overrule. Incessant positive vibes matched the rainbow embellished license plates zooming around us. What’s more, we simply weren’t dressed for stuffy Tranquillity Base Hotel & Casino; wearing only bikinis and towels we felt much more comfortable, much more welcome hanging around in Harry’s House. A big welcome is exactly what lies at the heart of this album, and a communal acceptance for what may come. Harry welcomes the listener whole-heartedly into his metaphorical musical home. Link? The lyrics on Little Freak, ‘I’m not worried about who you go home to, I’m just thinking about you,’ express gentle indifference- a definitive mood throughout the album matched most notably on As It Was. Difficult memories are not ignored but acknowledged and let go of and as you wander round Harry’s house space emerges allowing new ones to be made. When more painful experiences are dealt with, such as in Matilda, they are handled with remarkable gentleness. Steady and secure in tempo the lyrics ‘you don’t have to be sorry for leaving and growing up,’ are deeply sympathetic. Similar intent on Boyfriends however, ‘they take you for granted,’ made me smirk. There’s something off about the charismatic ex-boyband star expressing what I felt to be an exclusively painful female ennui. Speaking for people, that I’d rather hear speak or sing themselves. Of course, I am assuming Styles has never had a boyfriend himself. Whether this song is informed by any personal experience we don’t know, but I can’t shake the sense that this is Styles pandering just a little too hard. Nonetheless, this album is ultimately a tonic for the female psyche- an encouragement to accept what will be and an excuse to have a boogie in the meantime. And to that, we’ll crack open a coconut.

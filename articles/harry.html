       <p>‘My aim is to give the meaning free play and the fullest possible range. As with the abstract painters, my abstraction is an attempt to get a greater, more complete kind of realism.’ John Ashbery wrote this comment in response to his publisher’s request concerning his 1962 publication The Tennis Court Oath, a collection composed during a period of voluntary exile in Paris. But what are we to make of this clue into the poetic intentions of a poet whose work first presents itself as a cipher? Realism out of abstraction is indeed the central paradox of John Ashbery’s poetic worlds, a literary focus which was informed by his fascination in and practice of collage. Related to this, a second paradox of disappointment and fullness spears through his work, that is, a sustained disappointment with the process of meaning making and the simultaneous capability for his poetry to afford meaning ‘free play’ and full ‘range’. His poetry has a completeness, containing all the stuff of a dismantled reality. Sitting amongst the fragments and disappointments, Ashbery playfully rearranges them without reaching for some grand comprehensive explanation. At first obscure, some tentative truth begins to emerge out of the near misses within The Tennis Court Oath, and through the inversion of the physical properties of light and dark, and the roles of reader and poet, something like meaning is produced.

Ashbery plays with and inverts the physical properties of light in his poem ‘How Much Longer Will I Be Able to Inhabit the Divine Sepulchre’ to suggest a negative productivity, and a reimagining of the relationship between poet and reader. Opening with a series of questions such as, ‘Do dolphins plunge bottomward/ To find the light?’ the persona is immediately concerned with both a quest for and dread of light. The light in Ashbery’s poem is however a surreal material, it bounces ‘down’ forming a strange association with depth and hell, normally accompanied by darkness. Encased in a rock, and hearing ‘salt water dripping’ the persona speaks and tries to make sense of reality from the shadowy place of Plato’s cave or a place of death. The persona fears the prospect of being rescued and brought back into the living world because of ‘the light that comes in’ when the rock must necessarily be broken open. Like the roses on the ‘bilious tide of evening’ in his poem ‘To Redouté’, Ashbery describes a comparable physical dread in this poem, although not towards the ‘evening’ or the dying but towards light and the living. Sickening photophobia evoked from the synaesthetic expression ‘What about the smell of the light?’ suggests a physical dread at the prospect of the experience of being alive. Light is associated with an inflected instinct to survive, or a desire to withdraw. The distorted nature of light is most explicitly considered two thirds of the way through the poem:
<br>
<br>
‘But what buzzed in it had changed slightly
But not forever… But casting its shadow
On sticks, and looking around for an opening in the air, was
quite as if it had never refused to exist differently. […]’
<br>
<br>

The ‘it’ might be the ‘still purple’ sunlight in the garden, here described as slightly altered and surreal. Instead of sticks casting shadows the light itself casts its own shadow on the stick. Light is made material and is forced to ‘look around for an opening’, to negotiate space in a way it is exempt from in physical reality, its novel materiality is expressed through its mind-bending acquisition of the qualities of darkness and shadow. Light is also given personality, a playful deceptiveness ‘quite as if it had never refused to exist differently’ in the first place. Light is both present and elusive on the page, made subtly although definitively surreal.

Accumulating images from mysterious polyphonic sources, ‘the boy took out his own forehead’, and ‘“[…]meet me anyway at Cohen’s Drug Store/ In 22 minutes,”’ lull the reader into a strange voyeuristic dream world only to be jolted back into a sharp self-awareness in the final third of the poem when the persona addresses ‘you, my love, and light.’ There is shift here in the poem’s politics. The ‘you’ takes on power ‘laughing’ while the persona asks with a tinge of desperation ‘what am I going to do?’ The ‘you’ ‘twists the darkness in [their] fingers,’ assuming a sinister control of proceedings. Like the raving ‘shadow/ In the trunk’ or the night which escapes the box in ‘An Additional Poem’, Ashbery’s darkness here, is a  Miltonic darkness, active as though it had its own dark photons bursting energetically out of ‘trunks’ and ‘boxes’. Darkness ‘interrupts [the] story’, at a moment that corresponds with the power shift between the ‘you’ and the persona, or perhaps between the reader and poet. 
<br>
<br>
Surreal inversions of the physical properties of light pick apart our assumptions of relativity. Relativity that is, not only between light and dark, animation, and passivity as it exists in the physical world, but also relativity in the literary world, between the active perceptions and the passive contributions of readers and poets. This is a theme that recalls the ‘strong impression torn from the descending light’ in ‘The Additional Poem’, the ‘impression’ paradoxically ‘torn’ as though perception, or reading, might be violently active. Ashbery is concerned with the relation between reader and poet in this poem also, asking defensively, ‘Who are you, anyway?’ and ‘Am I wonder’. If Ashbery’s poetry is the universal set of all possible things, the limiting factor is us and him; the capabilities of the reader or the poet to comprehend them and to find meaning amongst the collage. It is this missing of meaning between poet and reader that Helen Vendler describes as ‘the pain of a rejected suitor’ in his poem ‘Paradoxes and Oxymorons’. And yet, through clipped clichés and fractured narrative lines Ashbery handles the failure of communication in his poetry playfully, restoring a sense community, paradoxically perhaps, through his wry polyphonic suggestion of it.

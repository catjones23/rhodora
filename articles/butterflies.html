       <div class="col-lg-6" style="background-color:#FFFFFF; color:#000000;"><h3>Retro fashion has been the name of the game...</h3>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>for the last five or so years as trends have swept across the decades in turn; psychedelic sixties t-shirts to seventies tie-dye to eighties flares to nineties space buns… Chronologically then, it’s no surprise that today the fashion industry finds itself obsessed with baby blue frosted eyeshadow, pastel pink mini skirt Y2k style. Its defining motif: the butterfly.
       <br>
       <br>
       Iconic Y2k poster girl, Dua Lipa announced on Facebook at the dawn of the year, “Only Butterfly energy in 2021.” This declaration reverberated across the world of social media and has been reiterated by a whole host of major celebrities. The insect craze has seeped into the style-psyche of fashion titans Bella Hadid and Kylie Jenner. In the music world, butterflies swoop and flutter subtly throughout the visualisers on Lil Nas X’s recent album ‘Montero.’ Ariane Grande, Queen Latifah and Harry Styles are all inked with butterfly tattoos. Featured in both the AW21 and SS22 fashion shows, we can assume that the butterfly is here to stay.

       <br>
       A seemingly logical progression of the industry’s obsession with all things retro, the butterfly may appear to be a tacky, even lazy, regurgitated 2000s motif. However, as we emerge from a year of various lockdowns, tentatively testing the waters of ‘normality,’ it’s worth taking a closer look at the sticky symbolism of the butterfly. I want to make the case that the butterfly motif symbolises more than consumerist nostalgia; that as we emerge collectively from our work-from-home cocoons, the butterfly is a symbol that speaks deeply to our time.
       <br>
       <br>
       Let’s start at the source. According to UK Vogue writer, Alice Cary, Ukrainian designer Masha Popova is the woman behind Bella Hadid and Dua Lipa’s iconic butterfly looks. Cary’s article features a photo of Dua dressed in a butterfly-shaped top that spans her chest and wraps a purple wing around her right shoulder. According to Cary’s interview with Popova, the designer included the butterfly motif at “random.” It was only when Dua Lipa wore the brand in her social media feed that the trend exploded.

       <br>
      The second key brand is Blumarine. When interviewed by US Vogue, Blumarine’s creative director, Nicola Brognano considered, what US Vogue describes as the “Paris Hilton dream shoe,” a baby-pink strap heel topped with a large rhinestone butterfly. “For me, the butterfly is like a sense of freedom, lightness.” says Brognano. This is the spirit of the motif according to the creators themselves; frivolous, accidental, light-hearted and free.
       <br>
       <br>
       How then, can the butterfly relate to the darker shades of the past year, when frivolity and lightness were luxuries that no one could afford? One artist who attempts to marry up the butterfly with more mellow emotions is Lil Nas X. In his recent cover of Dolly Parton’s ‘Jolene’ with BBC Radio 1’s Live Lounge, Lil Nas X powerfully pairs a sense of despair and hope. Changing the key to suit his baritone voice and shifting queer subtext to the front, Lil Nas X complicates the story of the suffering lover who is already pleading against the odds. Lil Nas X flashes his big doey eyes up at the camera intermittently, his low country growl sounds with soulful resignation; with an awareness of something already lost. The brooding atmosphere is reinforced by dim lighting and red and pink flower arrangements dotted about the studio as Lil Nas X sings the words “my happiness depends on you.” In an interview with Billboard, Lil Nas X says, “This song is kind of like beautifully sad, you know?” The lyrics certainly are, and praise for just how well Lil Nas X conveys them, has flooded in over twitter- praise from Dolly Parton herself. The twitter exchange is brief, but Parton signs off with the timely butterfly emoji.
       <br>
       <br>
       <h3>For Dolly, the butterfly is a way of making “positives out of negatives"</h3>
       <br>
       <br>
       Visually, the butterfly is ever-present throughout the performance in the form of Lil Nas X’s large rhinestone butterfly pendant; matching earrings as well as a large purple butterfly prop that perches on the singer’s microphone. Butterflies feature in the visualisers for the album ‘Montero’ and are the emoji of choice for the albums twitter handle. Interestingly Parton is also a big butterfly fan. Just like Grande, Latifah and Styles, Dolly Parton also has a tattoo of the insect. In an interview with People, Parton says her tattoos are “pretty” and that “they usually started out to cover some scar.” For Dolly, the butterfly is a way of making “positives out of negatives,” a way of healing.
       <br>
       <br>
       Since the early 2000s, a lot has changed. As we glance back at figures such as Beyonce, Avril Lavigne and Paris Hilton I wonder how much we really long for a return to the age of low-rise jeans and pre-financial crash optimism and how much we long for something different altogether. After the past two years, there seems to be a dual desire for a return to ‘normality’ as well as the need to take stock of our experiences of the pandemic. Perhaps then, the butterfly is not so much iconic nostalgia as gentle iconoclasm. Just like Parton’s tattoos, as we emerge from our socially distanced cocoons, the butterfly allows us to make positives out of negatives. Emerging tentatively at first, with the promise finally of beauty, freedom, levity.

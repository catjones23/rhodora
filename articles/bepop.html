       <p>This is the striking impression of Somaya Critchlow’s <i>‘Figure Holding a Little Teacup’</i> displayed in her solo exhibition in London <i>‘Underneath a Bepop Moon.’</i>  Sat, legs spread upon a Chippendale chair wearing only a scarf, hot pants and heels, the figure emits an easiness that is singularly masculine. Yet the figure is feminine: her heels, her scarf, her slim figure. The soft painterly qualities and use of light create an atmosphere of gentleness that in combination with the paintings miniature scale feels delicate and dainty. Critchlow communicates something ‘more elusive’ than ‘Renaissance portraiture and nineteen-sixties boudoir kitsch,’ according to the New Yorker. Like the other figures in the collection this woman ‘seems to fix [her] dispassionate gaze beyond the sexualised tropes that frame [her].’ (New Yorker) And it is this confidence with which the figure regards the act of being seen that makes Critchlow’s work so interesting. What she creates is a feminine ease- a muse that is wholly comfortable with being seen along with all her complicated feminine qualities.

       As Black History month draws to a close, I wanted to take a look at Critchlow’s work and how it sits within the broader context of art history. Her summer exhibition held at the London gallery Maximillian William in August, coincided with race riots in America as well as the powerfully symbolic destruction of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol, associated with Britain’s darker history as part of the slave trade. These events have made us question how we engage with our history as a nation; how we celebrate, memorialise and condemn historical figures; whether we re-write them or even erase them altogether. Somaya Critchlow’s artistic process provides a template for how we may productively engage with and even celebrate our art history in a way that works to make visible the under-represented.
       <br>
       <br>
       Critchlow’s work is not overtly political. First and foremost an artist of women and the female experience, Critchlow’s experience as a black woman living in Britain as has also had a critical role in her creative process. Some of her work, inspired by pop figures such as Nicki Minaj and Cardi B, presents a complexity and depth in female figures popularly dismissed as sex or pop icons. In focussing on these figures rarely depicted in art, Critchlow challenges the hypersexuality and eroticization of the black female body in popular culture. She describes her work as an exploration of the ‘psychological aspect of a black female body through popular culture and self-discovery, using the self-portrait as a starting point.’ It is easy to see how Critchlow has utilised self-portrait, indeed much of her work shows a physical resemblance to herself. However, these figures are fictional characters with fictional names and live in ‘imagined spaces’ . Although inspired by her memories and observations, Critchlow’s art operates in a realm distinct from reality and yet it has something very real to say about how we engage with our sometimes-problematic historical traditions.
       <br>
       <br>
       Making use of the self-portrait, Critchlow’s work is born out of a process of introspection or as she describes ‘self-discovery’- a process that has forced her to address the conflict of representing her own authentic experience through art in the context of a history that is not comfortable with the black female perspective. In an interview with Katy Hessel on ‘The Great Women Artists’ podcast, Critchlow talked of a discomfort with her instinctive love of European portraiture given the singular use of the white male muse. Critchlow notes how in art school there were frequently black male life models but never black females. One of the reasons Critchlow’s work is fascinating is the way in which she addresses this void, how she inserts the black woman into a style that they are historically excluded from. In doing this Critchlow’s work manages to celebrate the rich European art history she is inspired by, without forcing itself into the confined parameters of the traditional muse- that which is white and male. On confronting this imbalance of male and female perspectives in her work, Critchlow says- ‘in order to fit in I had to make myself comfortable - but that was going to make everyone else very uncomfortable.’ On first discovering her work, the confidence and relaxed stance of Critchlow’s figures feels bold- so unusual it seems to find presentations of women so at ease with their bodies in art. Indeed, Critchlow’s efforts to make herself feel comfortable seem all the more necessary as part of her process in creating an authentic presentation of black female experience.

       <br>
       What I find most refreshing about Critchlow’s work is that in focussing on expressing her experience authentically, Critchlow’s work maps out a method of making visible the under-represented in European art history whilst acknowledging and celebrating our shared, rich art history at the same time. Balancing influences from Diego Velázquez and Nicki Minaj; Peter Rubens and Cardi B- Critchlow demonstrates the reconciliatory power of art. Critchlow’s work fits into an art history that can evolve and answer back, a tradition that can be celebrated and corrected in the process rather than re-written or erased. In this sense, Critchlow provides a template for productive engagement with a darker historical past. At a time when our country is simultaneously grappling with its problematic racial history and trying to resolve the injustices of the past, this template seems all the more significant.
